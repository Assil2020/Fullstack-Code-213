            <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
            <p>
              Ciao Bella Pizza was born from a shared love for the rich culinary
              heritage of Italy. Inspired by our founders' travels across the
              Italian countryside, we set out to recreate the magic of
              traditional Italian pizzas right here in Algiers. Our commitment
              to preserving the authenticity of Italian cuisine is reflected in
              every dish we create.

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                To make the pizza dough, combine 400g of strong white bread
                flour and 100g plain wholemeal flour and 1 x 7g sachet of yeast
                in a large bowl with 1 teaspoon of fine sea salt. Make a well in
                the middle and pour in 325ml of tepid water. Bring the mixture
                into a ball with your hand, then knead on a flour-dusted surface
                for 10 minutes, or until elastic and smooth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Place into an oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave
                to prove for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
              </li>
              <li>
                Knock the dough back by kneading it briefly, then divide into 4
                balls. Cover again and leave to prove again for 1 hour.
              </li>
              <li>
                Preheat the oven to its highest setting. Pop a couple of pizza
                stones in the oven, or use 2 baking trays dusted with flour.
              </li>
              <li>
                For the sauce, peel 2 cloves of garlic and finely slice, along
                with the 1 fresh red chilli. Place in a saucepan on a medium
                heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and fry until golden.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add 1 x 400g tin of plum tomatoes, gently crushing them through
                your hands into the pan. Simmer for 5 minutes or until slightly
                thickened, then taste and season to perfection with sea salt and
                black pepper.
              </li>
              <li>
                Roll and stretch each ball of dough into 20cm rounds to make 4
                pizza bases.
              </li>
              <li>
                Spread each base with the tomato sauce, then pick over a little
                basil.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transfer the pizzas, two at a time, to the pizza stones or
                baking trays and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden and
                crisp. Repeat with the remaining pizzas.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using a speed peeler, shave 300g of asparagus spears and 30g of
                Parmesan into a large bowl. Add 200g of rocket and the remaining
                basil leaves, then toss with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil
                and a good squeeze of lemon juice.
              </li>
              <li>
                Top each pizza with a large handful of salad, then drizzle with
                balsamic vinegar, and tuck in!

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Preheat the oven to 240°C/475°F/gas 9 (full whack). Put a large
                non-stick, ovenproof frying pan on a medium-high heat.
              </li>
              <li>
                Squeeze the sausage meat out of the skins directly into the
                frying pan, with ½ a tablespoon of olive oil. Use a wooden spoon
                to roughly break up the meat.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add the oregano and fennel seeds (if using), and stir-fry until
                the sausage meat is lightly golden.
              </li>
              <li>
                Peel and finely slice the onions then add to the pan with a
                pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Add the jalapeños and a
                splash of their vinegar. Cook on a medium heat for 5 to 10
                minutes, or until the onions are soft and caramelised, stirring
                regularly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Meanwhile, for the dough, pile the flour into a bowl with a good
                pinch of sea salt. Add up to 250ml of water, mixing until it
                comes together as a smooth, elastic dough. You want it to be
                pliable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for a couple of
                minutes, then form into a rough round.
              </li>
              <li>
                Now, tip your topping out of the pan for a moment, returning the
                pan to a medium heat. Place the dough in the pan and – being
                careful not to touch the hot pan – use your fingertips to
                stretch out the dough to cover the base.
              </li>
              <li>
                Spoon the topping back over the pizza, spreading it out and
                pushing the sausage into the dough, then grate over the cheese.
              </li>
              <li>
                Turn the heat back up to medium-high and cook for 3 to 5
                minutes, or until the base has started to crisp up. Transfer to
                the oven for 10 minutes, or until golden, puffed up and
                sizzling. Serve with a nice salad, if you like.

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Place the flour in a large dough with a good pinch of sea salt.
                Pour 325ml of tepid water into a jug. Add the yeast and mix with
                a fork for a couple of minutes, until dissolved. Add a pinch of
                the flour and mix well, then pour the yeast mixture into the
                bowl. Use a fork to mix it all together until you can’t move it
                anymore – this will stop the dough sticking to your hands.
              </li>
              <li>
                Now get your clean hands in there and bring it together as a
                ball of dough, kneading and moving it around the bowl until the
                dough comes away from the sides.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transfer the dough to a flour-dusted surface and keep it moving,
                kneading, pushing and stretching it for 5 minutes, or until you
                have a silky and elastic dough.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use your floured hands to shape the dough into a rough ball, put
                it in an oiled bowl, and cover with a clean, damp tea towel.
                Allow it to prove for about an hour, or until doubled in size –
                ideally in a warm, draught-free place.
              </li>
              <li>
                Meanwhile, drizzle 1 tablespoon each of extra virgin olive oil
                and balsamic vinegar into a large bowl. Tear in the basil
                leaves, then halve the tomatoes and finely slice the courgette,
                adding them to the bowl as you go. Squash, destone and tear over
                the flesh of the olives and toss everything together gently with
                your hands.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once the dough has doubled in size, knock the air out by
                punching it with your fist, then knead on a flour-dusted surface
                for 30 seconds, or until smooth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to about the size of a
                tea towel, then rub the red pesto all over the dough using your
                hands, spreading it out to the edges. Scatter over the courgette
                mix evenly and tear over the mozzarella.

                Roll up the dough lengthways, like a Swiss roll, wrapping all
                the lovely fillings inside, then with a sharp knife, cut into
                twelve chunks. Place the pieces close together, swirl-side up,
                in an ovenproof pan (about 26cm) or on a snug, oiled baking
                tray, then cover with a clean tea towel. Leave to prove again
                for 30 minutes to an hour, or until it has doubled in size.

                Preheat the oven to 190ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Bake on the bottom of the
                oven for about 35 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Turn the
                loaf out onto a board and allow to cool slightly before serving.
                Delicious!
